3. Validate your email address by clicking on the link in the validation email you received.
4. Wait until an administrator has approved your account (you will receive a confirmation email).

If second factor authentication is required you will be presented with a page like in the figure below. Scan the QR 
code or type the code in bold to register your account in your authenticator app 
(example. [Google Authenticator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&hl=en&gl=US)).

After your account is created an administrator needs to validate your account before you can log in.
